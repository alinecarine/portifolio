                <H1>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skiier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, 
                I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.

When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, 
and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technolgy advancements in the front-end web development world.
